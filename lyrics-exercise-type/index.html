Power
<p>Got me sittin' by my phone, I've been waitin' for hours </p>
<p>On my line, sendin' mirror pics of you fresh out the shower</p>
<p>So I might as well swing over to your place</p>
<p>Mm-mm, na</p>
<p>It's crowded</p>
<p>In L.A. but I'll be there at eight, if the traffic allows it</p>
<p>Say you're down, I could show you around, if you're really about it, yeah</p>
<p>But for you, I got something to prove, what do you say?</p>
<p>What do you say? Uh</p> </center>
<br></br>



<center><p>Should we bring it right back?</p>
<p>Honestly, it's better like that</p>
<p>I know we been fallin' off-track</p>
<p>Bring it right back</p>
<p>Let's just let the time roll past</p>
<p>We don't gotta take it too fast</p>
<p>Bring it right back</p>
<p>You don't gotta stay the night</p>
<p>I just wanna take the time</p>
<p>I know all the things you like</p>
<p>Maybe if the mood is right</p>
<p>We could bring it right back	</p> </center>
<br></br>

<center><p>Say</p>
<p>Got the weed, we could sit by the beach if you wanna get faded</p>
<p>But if that's not the vibe, yeah it's cool, we could save it for later, yeah, yeah</p>
<p>I just like the way it feels when you're around</p>
<p>When you're around, na-na</p>
<p>Now, I know we're not dating, na-na</p>
<p>Maybe soon, by the way things go, we been talking for ages</p>
<p>Take it step-by-step, slow it down, we just need to be patient, oh</p>
<p>If the love feels good and it's real, it'll all work out</p>
<p>It all work out, yeah</p></center>
