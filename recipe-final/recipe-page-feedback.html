	<b><u>10/23 Recipe Feedback</u> </b>
	<p><b>Arianna: </b>
		<p>Since its about my grandma â€“ explain that its her recipe </p>
		<p>the title is not centered on the phone </p>
		<p>Spelled preperation wrong</p>
		<p>Likes the color scheme </p>
		<p>Left align the instructions </p>
		<p>Add space in general </p></p> 


	<br><b>Nat: </b>
	<p> Add padding on the color box on the top and the bootm - feels tight </p>
	<p> Like the color scheme </p>
	<p> Instructions have them listed as 1) 2) or space it out too much if one running body </p>
	<p>Paragraph margin bottom instead of br if br is too much space </p>

	<br> <b> What I will do: </b>
	<p>I will take both Nat and Arianna's feedback into consideraiton. I think I mainly need more spacing throughout the whole page and it feels cramped.  Also, something that needs attention is the alignment of my sections.</p>
