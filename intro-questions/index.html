			<li>I am really interested in UX design and am excited to take this class because coding will be important for the career I want to pursue</li> <p> <li>No experience</li> <p> <li>I hope to create a website that I am proud of. Additionally, master the skills I learn so I can focus on the design and layout of the website, not only just building it</li> <p> <li>Thinking about the end user is more important. I think simplicity and ease is key. Additionally, when something is printed, people can't interact with it.</li> <p> <li>
				<a href="http://www.thisisroy.com">This is Roy</a> I think this website is great because it is very clear and it is laid out in a very clever way. I especially enjoy how on the front page when you scroll over their projects you get a quick glimpse of the final project.</li> <p> <li> 
				<a href="https://weareflourish.com/our-work">We are Flourish</a> I think this website does a good has effective communication because it interacts and reflects what the user is doing. Everywhere the user's mouse goes, the website reacts. This is helpful to the user to see what their next move will be. </li> <p> <li> <a href= "https://www.southwest.com">Southwest Airlines</a> I really enjoy the Southwest website. The hierarchy of the page is very clear allowing the users to find what they want quickly. Additionally, the colors are capturing and their simple graphics make the process of buying a flight much less confusing and a little bit fun. </li>
