<b> Bambi 1 Mobile: </b> The text gets a little lost at the bottom where the grass is. Also, dont forget to optically align the text. Also, its a little weird how Bambi is 1/2 in the imageâ€“cropped weirdly try taking him out all together. I would blur the top 1/2 or even edit out the harsh black lines. 
<br>
<br>
<b> Bambi 2 mobile:</b> I would think about type choice overall, the text seems a little harsh compared to the night delicate images. Again, optically align text. I think you should think about putting more than one word on each line of text. Really nice placement and good image for white space.

<b> Bambi 3 mobile: </b> So cute. I would do a gradient blur but the placement is nice. The grass going into the goodnight is distracting. Could you push the image down and then have the quotation on the top? 
<br>
<br>
<b> Bambi 11 web:</b> For the 2nd quotation you dont need the quotation makes at the beginning. I feel like the two parts dont really link together that well. Maybe make the text larger. 
<br>
<br>
<b> Bambi 22 web:</b> Great placement and white space! 
<br>
<br>
<b> Bambi 33 web: </b> The placement seems off especially because the image is slanted so it feels like the text is slanted.
